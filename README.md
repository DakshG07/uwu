This is a placeholder README. I'll update it once we move it into the org.

## uwu
An experimental "package manager" for Catppuccin themes. A theme manager!
It allows you to:
- Install themes with one command
- Uninstall themes with one command
- Update themes with one command

## uwu
That's right. A roadmap:
- clone and stage repo
- symlink all flavours (in progress)
- symlink specific flavours
- updating themes
- repo searching through `bubbletea`
- uninstalling themes
- strategies (advanced installation)
